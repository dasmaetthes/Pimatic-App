# Pimatic-App

It's a simple app for Pimatic. [What is Pimatic?](https://www.pimatic.org)

Actually it's nothing else then a Webview showing the pimatic mobile frontend.

### Setup

Just enter the IP address of your pimatic installation.

### Useage

Swipe from left to right opens a navigation menu to enter settings.

### Note

I mainly wrote this small app for myself. So don't expect any support or further development.

### Download
